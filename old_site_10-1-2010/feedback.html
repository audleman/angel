  <p align="center"><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My experiences with the <em>Feldenkrais Method&reg;</em> </font></strong></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">by <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/%7Earora/">Sanjeev  Arora,</a> </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I  was led to the <em>Feldenkrais Method</em> while seeking a solution to a <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/%7Earora/RSI.html">RSI/typing  related injury that wouldn't go away</a>. However, in retrospect I  realize that in addition to curing my RSI it gave me a much better sense of my  body and a much better posture and alignment. Every aspect of my life  ---swimming, walking, sleeping, picking up new sports, etc.---became easier and  lighter.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I  turned to <em>Feldenkrais</em> because a friend I respected suggested it as a solution to  my hand and arm pain (RSI).&nbsp; I  found an excellent teacher, <a href="http://www.feldenkraisinseattle.com/aboutangel.html">Angel DiBenedetto</a>, during a 5-month stay in  Seattle. She learned from Moshe Feldenkrais, and is herself a trainer of other  <em>Feldenkrais</em> teachers. 8 lessons(over a 3-month period) completely changed my  view of myself. By the end, my hand issues were completely gone and my scoliosis  (which the medical profession thinks of as a skeletal problem, with no cure)  was much reduced.&nbsp;Good  practitioners have tremendous&nbsp;insight.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So  what can you expect when you get <em>Feldenkrais</em> lessons from a good  teacher?&nbsp; The immediate sensation  is one of calm that you have never known. You may realize that you have lived  in a background of muscular tension that you had never noticed until it went  away. (Kind of like the change in background noise level you might notice if  you moved from Manhattan to Montana.) This can be a powerful, even an emotional  experience.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do  not make the mistake of treating a <em>Feldenkrais</em> session like a massage or relaxation  session. The right attitude is one of curiosity and play and I think the <em>Feldenkrais  Method</em> it is  superior to yoga, tai-chi, pilates etc. It offers a tremendous&nbsp;insight  and it might occur to you that much of what you have known about  pain is incorrect. That we can learn more about ourselves from paying  attention, learning new options about how we move, how we live.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This  knowledge is extremely empowering for people  like me who has once suffered from chronic pain. However, I got a lot  more out of this than eliminating my discomfort, I learned a great deal  about the way in which I lived my life.<br>

  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
    
    a violinist, I feel that my work with Angel Di Benedetto in the <i>Feldenkrais Method</i><font size="1">&reg;</font> has been absolutely 
    
    invaluable. The work has not only sped my recovery from injury, 
    
    but greatly enhanced my sense of physical integrity, ease and grace-- 
    
    even with an activity as &quot;unnatural&quot; as playing the violin! 
    
    I would recommend it heartily to any string player, and indeed to 
    
    anyone interested in integrating physical movement more deeply into 
    
    their life and work. <br>

    a series of <i>Feldenkrais</i> lessons the chronic pain, numbness 
    
    and tingling resolved. More importantly, I learned about how to 
    
    manage and maintain my body to avoid these problems in the future.

    began learning the <i>Feldenkrais Method</i> when I was 12 years 
    
    old. It really helped me gain confidence and guide me through those 
    
    difficult years. I have since grown up to be an animator. One of 
    
    the main things they teach you in animation school is to look for 
    
    and emphasize weight and balance in your drawings. Having studied <i>Feldenkrais</i> beforehand, it definitely reinforced what I was 
    
    learning in Animation School and helped me be a better animator 
    
    because I felt movement from within. The <i>Feldenkrais Method</i> has benefited me as a person and as an artist as well. I highly 
    
    recommend it to anyone who is looking for some balance in their 
    
    lives.&quot;<br>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images/space.gif" width="1" height="1">I 
    
    was referred into the <i>Feldenkrais Method</i> because I was experiencing 
    
    chronic right knee pain. My first <i>Feldenkrais</i> lesson consisted 
    
    of very gentle manipulations mostly integrating my hips with my 
    
    spine. I was amazed that so little was awakening so much. Over many 
    
    lessons, my body/mind began to release tension, align itself naturally 
    
    and work with better ease of movement. <br>
                <img src="images/space.gif" width="1" height="1"><i>Feldenkrais</i> allows me to move with ease and work as a whole, not as separate 
    
    parts. It relieves tension, both physically and mentally, and it 
    
    helps me overcome restrictive patterns. <br>

    no longer have chronic knee pain and I can reduce any tension in

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images/space.gif" width="1" height="1">As 
    
    I prepared for my first ATM I was a little distracted partially 
    
    due to lack of sleep, because whenever I moved I would awake from 
    
    pain in my lower back and partially from the persistent pain I felt 
    
    from sitting on the floor. There was no position I could endure 
    
    for long. I had to keep moving. I was often exhausted. I tried self 
    
    medication with predictable results; I was then mentally as well 
    
    as physically impaired. In the first few lessons I felt like a stick 
    
    man with almost no flexibility or balance. I was clumsy. <br>
                <img src="images/space.gif" width="1" height="1">Throughout 
    
    that first series of lessons I got in touch with my body in ways 
    
    that I could not have anticipated before the lessons. I became confident 
    
    in my movements and a smile appeared on my face regularly. I had 
    
    begun to understand the principles of the <i>Feldenkrais</i> <i>Method</i> and how I could actually affect change on my own body/mind. I certainly 
    
    was thinking differently. As I began to take charge of my body I 
    
    lost that feeling of being a &quot;victim&quot; and could see possibilities 
    
    in my life. <br>
                <img src="images/space.gif" width="1" height="1">One 
    
    day after several lessons I caught myself jumping down a few steps 
    
    two at a time. I was surprised that I would do something like that 
    
    spontaneously when a few days' earlier steps were a dangerous obstacle. 
    
    The changes I experienced with those first few lessons altered the 
    
    way that I care for myself and how I relate to the world. My sleep 
    
    improved and with more rest an optimistic, confident attitude began 
    
    to emerge. I use <i>Feldenkrais</i> movements in my everyday life. 
    
    The ATMs &amp; FIs have been an integral part of my life for the

    have helped in every aspect of my busy life. My game of golf as

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">About 
    
    two years ago, I was wandering through life as usual, when the unexpected 
    
    happened. I tripped over a raised bit of sidewalk that had upheaved 
    
    from a tree root. The jolt caused a disk in my back to herniate, 
    
    resulting a tremendous amount of pain and reduced mobility. I endured 
    
    many trips to the Dr., was put on steroids for a time, and eventually 
    
    had an MRI. The diagnosis was clear, I would have to have surgery. 
    
    Not wanting to do that, I found out about the Feldenkrais Method 
    
    from a friend who was currently seeing a practitioner and decided 
    
    to give it a try.<br>
    I completed 15 Functional Integration sessions, and was amazed to 
    
    go from facing back surgery to now being pain free. I was so impressed 
    
    with my results that I've decided to become a practitioner, so that 
    
    I too, may be able to help others feel better and have a better 
    
    quality of life.<br>
