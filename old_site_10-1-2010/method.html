    Moshe Feldenkrais, D.Sc. (1904-1984) was a distinguished physicist,<br>
    engineer, martial artist, writer, educator and researcher. With 
    
    his broad<br>
    range of knowledge in biomechanics and movement, learning theories, 
    
    child development, dynamic systems theory and neuroscience, Dr. 
    
    Feldenkrais developed a highly sophisticated somatic learning system 
    
    for self improvement and rehabilitation.</font>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <i>Feldenkrais Method</i> can be experienced in two forms:<br>
        <i>Awareness Through Movement</i><font size="1">&reg;</font> and <i>Functional Integration</i><font size="1">&reg;</font>. Both are<br>
    generated by the same conceptual framework: utilizing our nervous 
    
    system's self-organizing and self-regulating faculties to improve 
    
    the quality of our actions, to reach our full potential and to feel 
    
    at our best.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Awareness 
    
    Through Movement</i> are group lessons in which the teachers<br>
    verbally directs exploration sequences that modulate the students 
    
    attention, intention and motion to create new movement skills, recover 
    
    lost ones or improve existing ones. The practice of <i>Awareness 
      
      Through Movement</i> leads to an independent learning that progressively 
    
    enhances our ability to act with efficiency, pleasure and spontaneity.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Functional 
    
    Integration</i> are one-on-one lessons custom-tailored to the<br>
    student's state and condition. The practitioners rely on their extensive<br>
    experience and understanding of movement to guide the student's<br>
    awareness and enhance sensory-motor patterns through gentle, noninvasive 
    
    touch. The student experiences a new awareness of ease and comfort 
    
    in their movements and learns an ever growing range of possibilities 
    
    for action and self-expression.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <em>Feldenkrais Method</em> is a somatic learning process that optimizes human functioning  (inclusive of any pathological conditions) by stimulating the  maturation of our nervous system through an organic learning process  based on movement awareness, pleasurable sensations, self-discovery and  organic growth.</font></p></td>
