  <p><span class="style7">&quot;I've had pain all my life and as I approached 60, I could no longer  keep up with myself as it got worse.&nbsp; My vitality and fire was  beginning to snuff out and I saw myself getting "crotchety."&nbsp; Then I  found myself running here and there to doctors and alternative  methodologies taking pills and doing exercises and stretching (which  caused me more pain). Everyone was an expert but no one showed me how  to manage my own life. <br>
      <br>
It wasn't until I discovered <em>Feldenkrais&reg; </em>that  I knew I was on the "intelligent" path. Thru the facilitation of Angel,  this work taught me how to use my brain the way it was meant to be  used, how to be aware, bring intention into action and learn how to  learn. <br>
<br>
Up until then, I let people tell me what to do, now I am in charge of  my own life and I foresee my golden years as becoming more self reliant  and active. <br>
<br>
Even if I don't wish to be a practitioner, I plan on taking the 4 year  training because I deserve the best. I am finally taking control of my  future and giving myself a new lease on life!&nbsp; <br>
<br>
I am already finding myself growing young!&quot;<br>
