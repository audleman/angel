  </font>I came to the training wanting to learn  something I could use in my work with other people, but I have come away with  profound effects in myself that I had never imagined.&nbsp; My self awareness has given me a new and developing  sense of myself that I know will serve me well for the rest of my life, no  matter what I do.<br>

What I found as a result of my <em>Feldenkrais&reg;</em> training was not only an  improvement in my physical well-being, but in also in my overall approach to  life.&nbsp; I move physically through space with more awareness and ease.&nbsp;  And I move through my mental and emotional space with more awareness and ease  as well. </p>
  <p>A key concept in <em>Feldenkrais</em>&reg; is that of efficiency,  organizing one&rsquo;s movements so there is less effort.&nbsp; Experiencing that  concept at a physical, visceral level in the Feldenkrais training provided me a  powerful analogy of how to extend that concept into organizing my&nbsp;life.  Amen. Alleluia. Thanks for all the good work you both do!</p>

    I was introduced to the <em>Feldenkrais Method</em>&reg; after having  reoccurrence of an injury in my lower back which had previously been operated  on. The Awareness Through Movement&reg; classes that I was attending very quickly  enabled me to find flexibility and ease in my movements again. Not only was I  experience this sense of ease in my physical body, but also things were  changing in my personal life. My thoughts were becoming clearer, issues and  blocks that I had personally were shifting without me even knowing how it happened.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    This method has become a  metaphorical framework for me to live my life and make sense of the world  around me. The simplicity of the movements and the awareness that develops in  the lessons is directly applied and shows up in my daily life in my whole self.  I can't imagine life without this awareness and the possibilities that are  always available to me.</p>

    A childhood accident  created a side-to-side curve in my back, making my hips, shoulders and head  unlevel. My balance was impacted, and simple things like restful sleep were  elusive. Forty years of chiropractic and massage therapies brought only  temporary relief and did not solve the underlying imbalances in my body. </p>
  <p>I was amazed and delighted  when my back straightened after six days of Awareness Through Movement &reg;  lessons with Angel and Richard and one 45-minute Functional Integration&reg; lesson  with Richard. My hips and shoulders became more level, and I was taller and  could move and sleep in ways that were easy and enjoyable. I now look forward  to using the Feldenkrais Method &reg; of learning to help create heightened  awareness in my clients to facilitate their own wonderful metamorphosis.</p>

    I feel very fortunate to  have been a part of the <em>Feldenkrais</em>&reg;  training. It has given me tools to safely take my yoga&nbsp;practice beyond  where I thought it could ever go, and to overcome self-perceived limitations in  my personal life. I look forward to a&nbsp;lifetime of studying this work.  &nbsp;</p>

    Now in my 3rd year of  training I have experienced the process of entering into confusion and finding  my way out, over and over again.&nbsp; The cumulative effect is that I am  developing a quality of buoyancy in my life.&nbsp; Life is still an up and down  ride, but I'm spending less time stuck in the depressions, and more time going  with the flow.</p>

    I have been focusing a lot  more on <em>Feldenkrais</em>&reg; since our  graduation.&nbsp; I also have been re-doing  the program in their SEFT II training. Its amazing how much you hear the second  time around. </p>

  <p>My training allowed me to  learn and mature in authentic intricate experience of self through the lessons  provided in the training. I felt encouraged to explore unknown aspects of  myself and accept challenges in a safe and supportive learning environment that  was comforting, yet not coddling, so as to ensure that I was to develop into a  more authentic and conscious human being. I went from being in so much pain  that I was barely able to roll over in bed, to embracing an enormous range of  pain-free, efficient and fluid movements in a variety of forms.</p>
  <p>From sitting and walking  comfortably to kickboxing and contortionism. Embracing the<em> Feldenkrais Method</em>&reg; changed my entire life for the better in  countless ways. Practicing the method is like having a special secret tool that  can help you no matter what movement challenge you face. For me, that gives me  courage and a sense of unwavering support that springs from my own brain and  ability to learn and transform accordingly in every challenge I may face.  Practicing the method gives me an enormous sense of support because I know now,  how self- reliant I can be.<br>
