  <p><em>Doing a </em>FELDENKRAIS<em> training yielded innumerable, positive changes in my life, but I never found a clear path to go forward as a 
    practitioner until I met Angel. <br>
  <br>
    Angel immediately honed in on my strengths and knew how to help me 
    further develop them.&nbsp; Our mentoring sessions are packed with content, 
    warmth and humor. <br>
  <br>
    Thanks to Angel's insightful and gentle encouragement, her deep 
    understanding of the work, and her "above and beyond" support, I'm 
    finding the knowledge and confidence I needed to pursue a professional 
    practice. <br>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><em>&quot;I 
    
    have recieved a few mentoring sessions with Angel and Richard and 
    
    it's really helped me to continue my education and grow as a practitioner. 
    
    While Angel and Richard's technique is quite different from one 
    
    another, I think this actually makes the experience more enriching. 
    
    I get different ideas, lines of thought process, and knowledge from 
    
    each of them. I get one-on-one coaching and more fine-tuned distinctions 
    
    that can be harder to get in a big classroom type environment. I 
    
    also learn things to practice with my other 'clients' I work with. 
    
    It kind of helps keep me on track and from getting out of touch 
    
    with the work.</em></font></p>
  <p><em><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I recently 
    
    took my husband to Angel for a mentoring session. (A spouse or close friend is nice because you can talk more openly 
    
    with the &quot;client&quot; there.) He enjoys the experience because 
    
    he gets to help me and benefits from my learning by getting an FI 
    
    lesson to boot. It's been a good way to include him in the process.</font></em></p>
  <p><em><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I practiced 
    
    an FI that Angel/my husband and I had done together<br>
    later with my neighbor. She has had a 'kink' in her shoulder for 
    
    2<br>
    months, tried massage therapy and acupuncture with no relief. After 
    
    we worked together in a session she could fully turn her head in 
    
    both directions and guess what? No shoulder kink anymore! It was 
    
    so cool! Only 2 sessions with her and she had results that greatly 
    
    impacted her life! I don't know if she was more surprised or if 
    
    I was. I contacted her 2 weeks later and found that she had even 
    
    integrated the lesson into her life. When she started to notice 
    
    the pain was coming on she would stop, notice what she was doing, 
    
    then ly on the floor, and do some of the movements she learned in 
    
    our session. Did I mention how cool that was? =)</font></em></p>
  <p><em><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I 
    
    really appreciate what the sessions have done for me and my clients.</font><br>

  <em>
  </p>
  </em>
  <p><em><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have been receiving weekly 1 hour FI mentorship from Angel.&nbsp;  It blows me away realizing that a weekly mentorship has made such a difference in my understanding of this work.<br>
        <br>
        Angel has a way of helping me build my confidence.&nbsp; She paces me really  well, talks to me in such a way that I can go further.&nbsp; I have been  bringing my own people and they too are pretty happy to get a "semi"  lesson.&nbsp; Mentoring has allowed me to be more effective and at the same  time, understand the underlying principles of giving an FI.&nbsp; Where was  I in my training?&nbsp; There is so much that I completely forgot.&nbsp; But when  I started up again, a lot of things came back, a lot didn't also,  hahaha......<br>
        <br>
        The difference between giving a good, great and excellent FI is very  obvious.&nbsp; The underlying subtleties of giving a clear FI where the  clients can really tune in is so simple yet easy to miss.&nbsp; I have to  say I am more confident and clear in my FI's with my clients and they  also noticed it.&nbsp; I've learned to really slow down and listen to their  needs.&nbsp; And now, they're all excited and looking forward to the next FI  session.<br>
        <br>
        I would highly recommend all of you to get some ongoing mentorship from  Angel and Richard.&nbsp; It's truly worth it and for me has sustained the  investment I made in my training.<br>
